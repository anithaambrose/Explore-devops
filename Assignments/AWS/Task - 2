Task Description:

Set up a VPC with an Internet gateway,
create a public subnet with 256 IP addresses, a private subnet with 256 IP addresses,
make a route table connecting the Internet gateway and the subnets,
and launch a Linux EC2 instance by using the above VPC and public subnet.
===========================================================================
Step -1 Creating a VPC (virtual Private Cloud) 

VPC_name = VPC-task ; CIDR block - 10.0.0.0/23 
where 32-23 = 9 , 2^9 = 512 IP addresses
--------- please refer to Screenshot 1 --------

Step -2 Creating an Internet Gateway and attaching it to the VPC 

Internal_Gateway_name = IGW-task
--------- please refer to Screenshot 2 --------

Step -3 Creating 2 Subnets (Private & Public - with 256 IP addresses)

Subnet-public - cidr block - 10.0.0.0/24 = 256 IP addresses
Subnet-private - Cidr block - 10.0.1.0/24 = 256 IP addresses

--------- please refer to Screenshot 3 --------

Step -4 Creating routing table & attaching a Subnets to make it PUBLIC

route_table_name = route-task
select subnet association to add subnet-public and save changes
--------- please refer to Screenshot 4 --------

Step -5 adding the internet gatway to the routes 

by clicking on add route setting the destination to 0.0.0.0/0 & itarget as IGW-task.
--------- please refer to Screenshot 5 --------

Step -6 Create an EC2 instance by using VPC & Subnet-public 

by editing the network setting in the laaunch instance page to the newly created VPC and subnet-public and enabling the auto assign IP address 
also, creatinga new Security group with inbound rule -; source type - anywhere and click on launch instance. 
verified by running ping command.

--------- please refer to Screenshot 6 for instance information & 7 for verifying the instance by doing connectivity check for google.com  --------
