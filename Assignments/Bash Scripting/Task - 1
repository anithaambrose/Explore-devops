---please refer to task 1.1 screenshot----

Given a file, replace all occurrence of the word "give" with "learning" from 5th line till the end in only those lines that contain the word "welcome"

we can use NR - keyword (number of records) in input file passed then awk command  simply prints the first 4 lines and serches for word welcome from the 5th line 
and use sed command to replce "give" with "learning" & store the updated line in a new file (output.txt)

ubuntu@ip-172-31-13-40:~/bash_ex$ cat output.txt 
1 Welcome to my first line in give devops.
2 Welcome to my second line in give devops.
3 Welcome to my third line in give devops.
4 Welcome to my fourth line in give devops.
5 Welcome to my fifth line in learning devops.
7 Welcome to my seventh line learning devops.
9 Welcome to my nineth line in learning devops.
6 my sixth line in give devops.
8 welcome to my eighth line in  devops.
ubuntu@ip-172-31-13-40:~/bash_ex$ 

based on the input file 
line6 is missing welcome so doesnt replace the word "give" &
line 8 doesnt have the word give so no changes made.
