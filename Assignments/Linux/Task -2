File Permission Task

Task Description:

Create a file with .txt extension (/home/demo.txt). 
Change the permission set of that file, so that any user can read it, group can read/write & owner can read/write/execute it.

/home directory - has both owner & the group as ROOT, hence we can use the below two methods to create & change permissions.

owner = rwx or 7
group = rw or 6
others = r or 4

 method: 1 
       sudo touch  - creates the file as Root
       Use u=rwx,g=rw,o=r  to change file permisssions 
------------please refer task 2.1 Screenshot ----------------------

 method : 2
      appending the others with write Permissions for /home directory, this lets us create the file with Ubuntu as both the  owner & group.
      Use numeric value 764 to change file permissions
