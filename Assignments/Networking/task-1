Task Description:

1.Get me the IP address of a particular domain (guvi.in). How do I find my CPU/memory usage of my server?. Test the connectivity between 2 nodes?

1.1 -> We can either use nslookup or dig command to fetch the IP address of a domain/website.
-----------please refer to task 1.1.1 screenshot------------------------------------


1.2 -> Top command  display both the CPU & memory usage of the server.
-----------please refer to task 1.1.2 screenshot------------------------------------

1.3 -> ping command  used to test the connectivity between 2 nodes.
-----------please refer to task 1.1.3 screenshot------------------------------------



2.I have deployed an application in guvi.com:9000, and logs show my app is running, but Iâ€™m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not ?

-> curl -I command confirms that the application is unreachable with error code 301 moved permanently
-> telnet & nc command can be used to check specific ports
->nmap command scans all open server ports for the specificed domain 

In this case port 9000 isnt available in the open ports list, hence confirms that port 9000 is NOT OPEN & ACTIVE.
